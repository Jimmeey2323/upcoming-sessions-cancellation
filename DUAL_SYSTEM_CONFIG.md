# 🎯 Dual System Configuration Summary

## 📊 **Current Setup Overview**

Your Momence automation now runs on **TWO separate systems** with different scripts and schedules:

### 🚆 **Railway.com (Primary - FREE)**
- **Script**: `lc1.js`
- **Schedule**: Every **5 minutes**
- **Cost**: **$0.04/month** (within $5 free credit)
- **Purpose**: Main member cancellation processing
- **Status**: ✅ Active

### ⚙️ **GitHub Actions (Secondary)**
- **Script**: `lc-7.js`
- **Schedule**: Every **15 minutes**
- **Cost**: ~$95/month (reduced from $191/month)
- **Purpose**: Alternative processing/backup system
- **Status**: ✅ Active

## 🔄 **Execution Timeline**

### **Every 5 minutes** (Railway):
```
00:00 - Railway runs lc1.js
00:05 - Railway runs lc1.js
00:10 - Railway runs lc1.js
00:15 - Railway runs lc1.js + GitHub Actions runs lc-7.js
00:20 - Railway runs lc1.js
00:25 - Railway runs lc1.js
00:30 - Railway runs lc1.js + GitHub Actions runs lc-7.js
```

## 📈 **Benefits of This Setup**

### ✅ **Advantages:**
1. **Redundancy**: Two independent systems
2. **Different Scripts**: Can run different logic
3. **Cost Optimization**: 50% reduction in GitHub Actions usage
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify either system independently
5. **Testing**: Can compare outputs from both scripts

### 💰 **Cost Savings:**
- **Before**: GitHub Actions only = $191/month
- **Now**: Railway ($0.04) + GitHub Actions ($95) = **$95.04/month**
- **Savings**: **$95.96/month (50% reduction)**

## 🛠 **System Management**

### **Railway Configuration** (Unchanged):
- **File**: `schedule.js` → calls `lc1.js`
- **Environment**: Same variables as before
- **Monitoring**: Railway dashboard logs

### **GitHub Actions Configuration** (Updated):
- **File**: `.github/workflows/schedule.yml`
- **Script**: Now runs `lc-7.js` instead of `lc1.js`
- **Schedule**: Changed from `*/5 * * * *` to `*/15 * * * *`
- **Monitoring**: GitHub Actions tab

## 🔧 **Future Optimization Options**

### **Option 1: Full Railway (Save More)**
If Railway proves reliable after testing:
- Disable GitHub Actions completely
- Save full $95/month
- Keep only Railway running

### **Option 2: Different Schedules**
- Railway: More frequent (every 2-3 minutes)
- GitHub Actions: Less frequent (every 30 minutes or hourly)
- Further cost optimization

### **Option 3: Script Specialization**
- `lc1.js`: Quick member processing
- `lc-7.js`: Comprehensive reporting/analysis
- Each optimized for different purposes

## 📊 **Monitoring Checklist**

### **Daily Checks:**
- [ ] Railway deployment status (railway.app dashboard)
- [ ] GitHub Actions runs (repository Actions tab)
- [ ] Google Sheets updates from both systems
- [ ] No error notifications

### **Weekly Review:**
- [ ] Compare outputs from both scripts
- [ ] Check Railway usage vs $5 credit
- [ ] Review GitHub Actions minutes usage
- [ ] Assess system reliability

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Railway Fails:**
- GitHub Actions continues as backup every 15 minutes
- Check Railway logs and redeploy if needed
- No service interruption

### **If GitHub Actions Fails:**
- Railway continues primary processing every 5 minutes
- Check workflow logs and repository secrets
- Minimal impact on operations

### **If Both Fail:**
- Run manually: `node lc1.js` or `node lc-7.js`
- Check environment variables and API credentials
- Redeploy both systems

## ✅ **Current Status**

✅ **Railway**: Running `lc1.js` every 5 minutes  
✅ **GitHub Actions**: Running `lc-7.js` every 15 minutes  
✅ **Cost Optimized**: 50% reduction achieved  
✅ **Redundancy**: Dual system backup  
✅ **Monitoring**: Both systems trackable  

**Next Review**: Check both systems after 24 hours of operation to ensure smooth dual execution.
