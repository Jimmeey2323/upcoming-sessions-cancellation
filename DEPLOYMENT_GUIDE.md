## 🔄 **GitHub Actions Features**

### ✅ **What's Included:**
- **Automated Schedule**: Configured for every 5 minutes ⚠️ (actual timing varies - see below)
- **Manual Triggers**: Run on-demand from GitHub UI (for immediate execution)
- **Smart Validation**: Checks all credentials before running
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed execution logs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with debugging info
- **Performance Monitoring**: Execution time and statistics
- **Artifact Storage**: Failed run logs saved for debugging
- **Concurrency Control**: Prevents overlapping executions
- **Environment Detection**: Optimized for both local and GitHub Actions

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: GitHub Actions Scheduling Limitations**
- While configured for every 5 minutes, GitHub does not guarantee precise scheduling
- **Actual execution**: Typically every 1-3 hours (not every 5 minutes)
- This is a documented GitHub platform limitation
- See [GITHUB_ACTIONS_SCHEDULE_LIMITATIONS.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_SCHEDULE_LIMITATIONS.md) for details and solutions

### 📊 **Real-time Monitoring:**
- View live execution in Actions tab
- Get detailed statistics and performance metrics
- Automatic error notifications with debugging info
- Success/failure status with booking counts

---

## 🛠 **Workflow Configuration**

### **Current Schedule:** Configured for every 5 minutes (actual varies)
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # UTC time - configured interval
```
⚠️ **Note**: Due to GitHub Actions platform limitations, actual execution typically occurs every 1-3 hours.

### **Alternative Schedules (more reliable):**
```yaml
# Every 30 minutes
- cron: '*/30 * * * *'

# Every hour  
- cron: '0 * * * *'

# Business hours only (9 AM - 5 PM UTC, Mon-Fri)
- cron: '*/15 9-17 * * 1-5'

# Every 2 hours
- cron: '0 */2 * * *'
```

## 📈 **Expected Performance**

### **GitHub Actions Usage:**
- **Execution Time**: 2-5 minutes per run
- **Monthly Usage**: ~450-900 minutes (well within free 2,000 limit)
- **Cost**: $0 (free tier sufficient)

### **Processing Speed:**
- **Members**: 50-100 per minute
- **Concurrent Processing**: 8 members simultaneously  
- **Batch Cancellations**: 3 bookings per member in parallel
- **Smart Retries**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

---

Your sheet will automatically update with:
- ✅ **Member Details**: ID, email, name, phone
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: COMPLETED/PARTIAL/FAILED/ERROR
- ✅ **Cancellation Results**: Successful/failed booking IDs
- ✅ **Timestamps**: Last processed time
- ✅ **Statistics**: Total bookings processed
- ✅ **Error Details**: Specific error messages for debugging

## 🚨 **Monitoring & Alerts**

### **GitHub Actions Dashboard:**
1. Go to your repo → **Actions** tab
2. View **"Momence Member Cancellation Automation"** workflow
3. See real-time execution logs and history
4. Monitor success/failure rates

### **Google Sheets:**
- Live updates every 5 minutes
- Historical data preservation
- Easy sharing and collaboration
- Mobile access via Google Sheets app

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### 1. **"Secrets missing" error:**
- Add required secrets in GitHub repo settings
- Ensure secret names match exactly

#### 2. **"Google Sheets access denied":**  
- Verify Google Sheet ID is correct
- Check OAuth credentials haven't expired
- Ensure sheet is accessible

#### 3. **"Momence API errors":**
- Update access token and cookies
- Check if credentials have expired

#### 4. **Workflow not running at expected frequency:**
- **This is normal!** GitHub Actions does not guarantee scheduled timing
- Expect runs every 1-3 hours, not every 5 minutes
- See [GITHUB_ACTIONS_SCHEDULE_LIMITATIONS.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_SCHEDULE_LIMITATIONS.md)
- Use manual triggers for immediate execution
- Enable Actions in repository settings if not running at all
- Check if workflow file is in correct path: `.github/workflows/schedule.yml`

### **Debug Mode:**
Run manually with debug logging:
```bash
DEBUG=* node lc-7.js
```
